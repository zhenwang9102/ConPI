This repository contains source code for our WSDM 2021 paper, [Modeling Context Pair Interaction for Pairwise Tasks on Graphs](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3437963.3441744). 

In this paper, we propose a framework to model context interaction between target nodes in the graph. The framework contains two persepctives, node-centric and pair-centric, in which the former formulates an interaction-aware node representations for the prediction (ConPI-node), while the latter focuses on learning context pair representations directly for pairwise prediction (ConPI-pair). In addition, we proposa to pre-train a pair embedding on homogeneous graphs to further enhance the ConPI-pair model.
